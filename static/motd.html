<h4>Planning for 2021/22?</h4>
<p>
    Several instructors have contacted me about budgeting for Runestone in the next
    school year! Thank you! If you are able to include any amount of support for
    Runestone in your budget for next year that would be awesome! Some departments have
    even added a $10/student lab fee to help support Runestone! I am happy to send you an
    invoice!
</p>
<p>
    If you are curious about Runestone's finances, I am as transparent as possible.
    please see

<h4>Support Runestone</h4>
<p>
    Did you know that over 50,000 students have registered on Runestone Academy since
    August 1 2020!? At $100 a textbook we have saved students over $5 million! Thats a
    lot of students and a lot of savings. Please consider a
    <a href="/runestone/default/donate">donation</a>
    to help pay for server costs and the ongoing development needed to keep runestone
    online.
</p>
<p>
    A huge <strong>Thank You!</strong> to those of you who have sent your support
    already.
